D key


[Verse 1]

            D              A          Bm
For all the times that you rain on my parade
            Em               D        A
And all the clubs you get in using my name
              D                  A            Bm
You think you broke my heart, oh girl for goodness sake
              Em            D           A
You think I'm crying, on my own, well I ain't
                   D           A                    Bm
And I didn't wanna write a song cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
   Em        D                A
I don't but, you still hit my phone up
                 D        A                Bm
And baby I'll be movin' on and I think you should be somethin'
              Em         D                A
I don't wanna hold back, maybe you should know that


[Pre-Chorus]

              Bm           G              D
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
            Bm      G                D
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
                 Bm          G               D                A
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
          Bm  G            A
And now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own

[Chorus]

             D        A       Bm        G
Cause if you like the way you look that much
        D                 G        D
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
           D          A         Bm      G
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
D                 G        D
You should go and love yourself

[Verse 2]

             D                A        Bm
But when you told me that you hated my friends
         Em               D           A
The only problem was with you and not them
          D             A              Bm
And every time you told me my opinion was wrong
             Em             D            A
And tried to make me forget where I came from
                   D           A                    Bm
And I didn't wanna write a song cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
   Em        D                A
I don't but, you still hit my phone up
                 D        A                Bm
And baby I'll be movin' on and I think you should be somethin'
              Em         D                A
I don't wanna hold back, maybe you should know that

[Pre-Chorus]

              Bm           G              D
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
            Bm      G                D
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
                 Bm          G               D                A
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
          Bm  G            A
And now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own

[Chorus]

             D        A       Bm        G
Cause if you like the way you look that much
        D                 G        D
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
           D          A         Bm      G
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
D                 G        D
You should go and love yourself
