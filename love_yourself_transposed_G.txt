G key


[Verse 1]

            G              D          Em
For all the times that you rain on my parade
            Am               G        D
And all the clubs you get in using my name
              G                  D            Em
You think you broke my heart, oh girl for goodness sake
              Am            G           D
You think I'm crying, on my own, well I ain't
                   G           D                    Em
And I didn't wanna write a song cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
   Am        G                D
I don't but, you still hit my phone up
                 G        D                Em
And baby I'll be movin' on and I think you should be somethin'
              Am         G                D
I don't wanna hold back, maybe you should know that


[Pre-Chorus]

              Em           C              G
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
            Em      C                G
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
                 Em          C               G                D
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
          Em  C            D
And now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own

[Chorus]

             G        D       Em        C
Cause if you like the way you look that much
        G                 C        G
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
           G          D         Em      C
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
G                 C        G
You should go and love yourself

[Verse 2]

             G                D        Em
But when you told me that you hated my friends
         Am               G           D
The only problem was with you and not them
          G             D              Em
And every time you told me my opinion was wrong
             Am             G            D
And tried to make me forget where I came from
                   G           D                    Em
And I didn't wanna write a song cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
   Am        G                D
I don't but, you still hit my phone up
                 G        D                Em
And baby I'll be movin' on and I think you should be somethin'
              Am         G                D
I don't wanna hold back, maybe you should know that

[Pre-Chorus]

              Em           C              G
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
            Em      C                G
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
                 Em          C               G                D
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
          Em  C            D
And now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own

[Chorus]

             G        D       Em        C
Cause if you like the way you look that much
        G                 C        G
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
           G          D         Em      C
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
G                 C        G
You should go and love yourself
