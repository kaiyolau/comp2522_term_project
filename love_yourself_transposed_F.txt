F key


[Verse 1]

            F              C          Dm
For all the times that you rain on my parade
            Gm               F        C
And all the clubs you get in using my name
              F                  C            Dm
You think you broke my heart, oh girl for goodness sake
              Gm            F           C
You think I'm crying, on my own, well I ain't
                   F           C                    Dm
And I didn't wanna write a song cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
   Gm        F                C
I don't but, you still hit my phone up
                 F        C                Dm
And baby I'll be movin' on and I think you should be somethin'
              Gm         F                C
I don't wanna hold back, maybe you should know that


[Pre-Chorus]

              Dm           Bb              F
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
            Dm      Bb                F
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
                 Dm          Bb               F                C
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
          Dm  Bb            C
And now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own

[Chorus]

             F        C       Dm        Bb
Cause if you like the way you look that much
        F                 Bb        F
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
           F          C         Dm      Bb
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
F                 Bb        F
You should go and love yourself

[Verse 2]

             F                C        Dm
But when you told me that you hated my friends
         Gm               F           C
The only problem was with you and not them
          F             C              Dm
And every time you told me my opinion was wrong
             Gm             F            C
And tried to make me forget where I came from
                   F           C                    Dm
And I didn't wanna write a song cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
   Gm        F                C
I don't but, you still hit my phone up
                 F        C                Dm
And baby I'll be movin' on and I think you should be somethin'
              Gm         F                C
I don't wanna hold back, maybe you should know that

[Pre-Chorus]

              Dm           Bb              F
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
            Dm      Bb                F
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
                 Dm          Bb               F                C
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
          Dm  Bb            C
And now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own

[Chorus]

             F        C       Dm        Bb
Cause if you like the way you look that much
        F                 Bb        F
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
           F          C         Dm      Bb
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
F                 Bb        F
You should go and love yourself
